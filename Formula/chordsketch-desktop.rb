# Homebrew formula that builds the ChordSketch desktop app from source.
# Generated from this template with the release's source archive URL and
# checksum. Do not edit the generated file manually.
#
# The cask installs a prebuilt, unsigned DMG, and Homebrew puts the
# quarantine flag on everything a cask downloads, so Gatekeeper checks it
# on first launch. This formula compiles ChordSketch.app on the user's
# machine instead: no finished app is downloaded, so there is nothing to
# quarantine and no Apple Developer ID certificate is involved.
